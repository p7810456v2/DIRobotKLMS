# DIRobotKLMS
The KLMS DI Robot Source

Feel free to learn from this, especially if you are another DI team making your own robot in the future!

All the code is written for Arduino, using Arduino's version of C++.

Credit to the makers of the RF24, AFMotor (Adafruit) and all the other libraries that we have used, including the Arduino ones!

Just don't repost this anywhere, link directly back to Github.
